     Level A few code lists that FHIR defines are hierarchical - each code is assigned a level.  In this scheme, some codes are under other codes, and imply that the code they are under also applies

   Display                  The display (used in the display element of a Coding). If there is no display, implementers should not simply display the code, but map the concept into their application
