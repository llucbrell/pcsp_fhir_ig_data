     Level A few code lists that FHIR defines are hierarchical - each code is assigned a level.  In this scheme, some codes are under other codes, and imply that the code they are under also applies
    System                                                                                              The source of the definition of the code (when the value set draws in codes defined elsewhere)

   Display                  The display (used in the display element of a Coding). If there is no display, implementers should not simply display the code, but map the concept into their application
Definition                                                                                                                                                An explanation of the meaning of the concept
