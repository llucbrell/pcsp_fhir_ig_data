Cardiac problems (High risk) RT >= 35 Gy to a vol exposing the heartAnthracyclines (doxorubicin isotoxic equivalents)>= 250 mg/m2 A physical cardiac examination at every LTFU visit, at least every 5 years. Screening for modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, obesity, smoking and low levels of physical activity). - ECG once at entry into LTFU. Repeat ECG once after the age of 18 years if entry into LTFU was at a younger age. - Echocardiogram with specific attention to left ventricular systolic function, to valvular structure and function and to the pericardium, starting 2 years after treatment and at least every 2-3 years; Echocardiogram with specific attention to left ventricular function, prior to pregnancy or in the first trimester, if female - Refer to a cardiologist if an abnormal ejection fraction or if other abnormalities are identified - Refer for interventions to help avert the risk of symptomatic cardiomyopathy if modifiable cardiovascular risk factors are identified Refer to a cardiologist if an abnormal ejection fraction or if other abnormalities are identified - Refer for interventions to help avert the risk of symptomatic cardiomyopathy if modifiable cardiovascular risk factors are identified
