Once the process of puberty is complete: Test testosterone levels early in the morning every 2-3 years. If this is not possible, perform LH blood dosage.

In case of abnormal or no pubertal development, check FSH and 17betaestradiol levels. In women who have already had their first menstrual cycle: Monitor the regularity of menstrual cycles. In case of irregular cycles (less than 21 days or more than 35 days) or if you have not had a cycle for at least 4 months, we recommend a blood test for FSH and estradiol and an endocrine/gynaecological check-up. These examinations are also recommended if you wish to find out about your fertility status.

In addition, an otorhinolaryngological evaluation should be performed in case of tinnitus (ringing/whistling in the ear).

Measure fT4, TSH, and cortisol levels early in the morning every year; in case of lack of progression of pubertal development also check FSH and LH levels. In the post-pubertal period: - Perform a clinical check-up every year and in women also check the regularity of the menstrual cycle. - Check blood values of fT4, TSH, LH, FSH, iGF1 and cortisol early in the morning every year. - In men, also check total and free testosterone. - In women also check 17-beta estradiol Continue these check-ups for at least 15 years after diagnosis.

Transaminases, gammaGT and alkaline phosphatase should be measured at least once after treatment ends. In case of an increase in liver enzyme values: if between 1-2 times the normal value: repeat the test within 1 year. If more than 2 times the normal value: repeat the test within 2 months. In case of persistent liver abnormalities: Ask a hepatologist or gastroenterologist for further indications.

Repeat test within 6 months if serum ferritin is above 500 ng/ml. In case of persistent hyperferritinemia, perform an MRI scan to quantify the iron content in the liver. If the latter is confirmed, ask a haematologist about the appropriate treatment (such as phlebotomy or chelation therapy).

Start broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy as soon as possible in case of: fever >38.3°C, animal bite with skin lesions, or other symptoms of severe infection (sepsis) such as cold/chills, low blood pressure, mental confusion and signs of rigidity. In such cases, blood count and blood culture should be performed immediately if possible. If travelling abroad, contact your local health authorities for information on the need for any prophylactic vaccinations.
