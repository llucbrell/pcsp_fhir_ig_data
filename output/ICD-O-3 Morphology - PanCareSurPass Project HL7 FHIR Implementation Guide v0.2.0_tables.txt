    2 negative-infinity http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/data-absent-reason         Negative Infinity (NINF)  The numeric value is excessively low and unrepresentable due to a floating point processing error.
    2 positive-infinity http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/data-absent-reason         Positive Infinity (PINF) The numeric value is excessively high and unrepresentable due to a floating point processing error.
    1     not-performed http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/data-absent-reason                    Not Performed        The value is not available because the observation procedure (test, etc.) was not performed.

     Level A few code lists that FHIR defines are hierarchical - each code is assigned a level.  In this scheme, some codes are under other codes, and imply that the code they are under also applies

   Display                  The display (used in the display element of a Coding). If there is no display, implementers should not simply display the code, but map the concept into their application
