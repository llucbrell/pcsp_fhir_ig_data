Carina Schneider is a psychologist, Managing Director of CCI Europe and a former project manager at the Austrian Childhood Cancer Organisation, focusing on the development and implementation of structures for long-term follow-up care of now adult childhood cancer survivors. At the age of 17 she was diagnosed with Ewing’s Sarcoma and has been active as a patient advocate at a national level since 2009. Carina has been involved in national efforts to implement the SurPass in Austria since 2016.
Hannah Gsell, MSc, is a psychologist and survivors-representative. As such, she is particularly concerned with integrating childhood cancer survivors into their own medical treatment in order to enable them to live self-determined lives with the consequences of the disease. She was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at the age of 14 and has been a patient advocate at the national level since 2011 and co-founded a regional, active survivors group in Austria. There Hannah played a major role in the implementation and further development of the so-called “Mentoring Project”, in which survivors accompany and support currently affected children or young people and their families with their own experiences. Since 2019, she has been leading the Austrian survivors group. Since the end of 2020 Hannah is co-founder and chair of the first independent survivors organisation in Austria. Since 2020, she has been a project manager at CCI Europe. As such and as a Survivors Representative, she is active in the PanCareFollowUp and PanCareSurPass project.
Hannah, Anita and Carina oversee the involvement of survivors across all activities of the project and plays a significant role in the communications activities, working in close collaboration with SIOP Europe and the PanCare network to make sure survivors and other key stakeholders are well informed.
