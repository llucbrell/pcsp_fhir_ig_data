Scope

Specify HL7 FHIR logical models and profiles to be used within the European project PanCareSurPass. This project studies the scale-up and implementation of the digital Survivorship Passport to improve people-centred care for childhood cancer survivors.
The PancareSurPass Project
Overview

PanCareSurPass is a EU funded Research and Innovation action aiming to study the scale-up and implementation of the digital Survivorship Passport to improve people-centred care for childhood cancer survivors.

PanCareSurPass will conduct a robust assessment of the implementation of the Survivorship Passport by first conducting a pre-implementation study in six countries (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Spain) representing three infrastructural scenarios in Europe. The Survivorship Passport is an innovative, digital tool, developed in previous EU-funded projects, that can be used to overcome well-known knowledge gaps to improve people-centred long-term survivorship care.
Objectives

The overall aim of PanCareSurPass is to leverage the digital transformation of healthcare to improve people-centred survivorship care by scaling up and implementing an interoperable SurPass v2.0 across Europe.
Preparation for Implementation

    design and conduct a multi-country pre-implementation study to assess the barriers and facilitators for scaling up use of the SurPass v2.0

    develop a practical Implementation Strategy informed by the findings of the pre-implementation activities and IT technical specifications for SurPass v2.0 ensuring interoperability and cybersecurity.

    develop, test and launch SurPass v2.0 using the IT specifications developed use in the multi-country implementation study.

Implementation and evaluation

    conduct a multi-country implementation study of SurPass v2.0 for people-centred care with >5-year CCS and to assess implementation in terms of people-centred care (e.g. activation, empowerment, satisfaction, increase in knowledge), feasibility and cost effectiveness.

    conduct a parallel observational qualitative study using SurPass v2.0 for delivering people-centred survivorship care to <5-year CCS and >5-year CCS (but with limited treatment data available).

European Future Implementation & Achieving Impact

    develop a Prediction Model using data from the pre-implementation activities and multi-country implementation study to enable healthcare decision-makers to assess the suitability and costs of SurPass v2.0.

    host an Implementation Toolkit for further European implementation of the SurPass for people-centred care in various healthcare settings across Europe.

    disseminate and communicate the importance of people-centred survivorship care and results of PanCareSurPass to key stakeholders to promote future implementation of SurPass v2.0 to improve people-centred survivorship care in Europe.

Package hl7.fhir.uv.extensions.r4#5.1.0

This IG defines the global extensions - the ones defined for everyone. These extensions are always in scope wherever FHIR is being used (built Sat, Apr 27, 2024 18:39+1000+10:00)

Package hl7.fhir.uv.bulkdata#2.0.0

FHIR based approach for exporting large data sets from a FHIR server to a client application (built Fri, Nov 26, 2021 05:56+1100+11:00)

Package hl7.fhir.r4.examples#4.0.1

Example resources in the R4 version of the FHIR standard

Package hl7.fhir.uv.sdc#3.0.0

The SDC specification provides an infrastructure to standardize the capture and expanded use of patient-level data collected within an EHR.
This includes two components:
* Support more sophisticated questionnaire/form use-cases such as those needed for research, oncology, pathology and other clinical domains.
*Support pre-population and auto-population of EHR data into forms/questionnaires for uses outside direct clinical care (patient safety, adverse event reporting, public health reporting, etc.). (built Tue, Mar 8, 2022 18:32+0000+00:00)

Package hl7.fhir.us.core#5.0.1

The US Core Implementation Guide is based on FHIR Version R4 and defines the minimum conformance requirements for accessing patient data. The Argonaut pilot implementations, ONC 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS), and ONC U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) v1 provided the requirements for this guide. The prior Argonaut search and vocabulary requirements, based on FHIR DSTU2, are updated in this guide to support FHIR Version R4. This guide was used as the basis for further testing and guidance by the Argonaut Project Team to provide additional content and guidance specific to Data Query Access for purpose of ONC Certification testing. These profiles are the foundation for future US Realm FHIR implementation guides. In addition to Argonaut, they are used by DAF-Research, QI-Core, and CIMI. Under the guidance of HL7 and the HL7 US Realm Steering Committee, the content will expand in future versions to meet the needs specific to the US Realm. These requirements were originally developed, balloted, and published in FHIR DSTU2 as part of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) sponsored Data Access Framework (DAF) project. For more information on how DAF became US Core see the US Core change notes. (built Wed, Jun 22, 2022 19:44+0000+00:00)

Cross Version Analysis

​This is an R4 IG. None of the features it uses are changed in R4B, so it can be used as is with R4B systems. Packages for both R4 (hl7.eu.fhir.pcsp.r4) and R4B (hl7.eu.fhir.pcsp.r4b) are available.

    SurPass Overview
    HL7 FHIR Models

SurPass Overview

The Survivorship Passport (SurPass) is a digital tool based on international clinical guidelines that provides childhood cancer survivors (CCS) and health care professionals (HCPs) with the information needed for long-term follow-up survivorship care, better health promotion, improved late effects management and secondary cancer prevention. The SurPass provides an overview of all relevant personal health data related to the cancer treatment of CCS (e.g. demographics, cancer diagnosis, therapeutic management etc.) in a Treatment Summary together with a personalized Survivorship Care Plan.

In addition there are format specific definition files:

These files should be the first choice whenever generating any implementation artifacts since they contain all of the rules about what makes these profiles valid. Implementers will still need to be familiar with the content of the specification and profiles that apply in order to make a conformant implementation. See the overview on validating FHIR profiles and resources.

There are also specific packages for the R4 and R4B FHIR specifications:
